# Blender Project Setup Addon

## Overview

Blender Project Setup is an addon designed to streamline the process of creating structured project folders for Blender artists. The addon allows users to define a base path and project name, and automatically generates a well-organized folder structure to keep assets, models, textures, and other project elements properly categorized.

## Features

- Automatically create a structured folder system for new 3D projects.
- Customize base paths and project names.
- Default folder structure includes subfolders for:
  - Concepts (References, Sketches)
  - Models (Base Meshes, Sculpted Models, Retopology)
  - Textures (UV Maps, Baked Textures, Hand Painted)
  - Rigs (Bones, Controllers)
  - Animations (Walk Cycles, Facial Expressions)
  - Render (Preview, Final)
  - Backups (Old Versions, Auto Saves)
- Predefined folder templates you can select from, including Basic, Animation, Sculpting, and Game Development templates.
- Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux with default base paths depending on the OS.

## Installation

1. Download the `.zip` file of the addon from the [releases page](https://github.com/GuameDev/Blender.Addon.ProjectSetup/releases/tag/v1.1.0).
2. Open Blender and navigate to `Edit` -> `Preferences`.
3. Go to the `Add-ons` tab and click on `Install...`.
4. Select the downloaded `.zip` file and click `Install Add-on from File`.
5. Enable the addon by checking the box next to **Blender Project Setup**.
6. You should now see a new panel under the `3D View` sidebar with project folder creation options.

## How to Use

1. Open Blender.
2. In the 3D View panel, find the new **Project Folders** tab.
3. Define your project name and base path or use the default base path.
4. Select a folder template from the dropdown (e.g., Basic, Animation, Sculpting, Game Development).
5. Click the `Create Project` button.
6. The addon will automatically create a structured folder setup for you based on the provided project name and base path.
